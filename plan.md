# Homepage Improvement Plan

## Dashboard Widgets

### Bookmarks / Read Later
A widget for saving articles/links to read later (like a mini Pocket). The current links section is all static — this would be a dynamic list you can add to and clear from.

### Habit Tracker
Simple daily check-in habits (exercise, reading, etc.) that show streaks. Pairs nicely with the calendar widget already on the dashboard.

### GitHub Activity
Show recent commits/contributions pulled from the GitHub API.

## New "Books" Entries

### Movies / TV Shows
Track movies and shows with ratings. Already linking to Netflix/Disney+ in the links section and have Romm for ROMs — this is a natural extension.

### Books (Actual Books)
A reading tracker with ratings. The section is literally called "The Books" so this fits perfectly.

### Concerts / Events
Similar to the conferences tracker but for personal events attended — concerts, meetups, etc.

## Quality of Life

### Notes / Snippets
A quick code snippets or notes widget on the dashboard. Shorter than memos, more like a scratchpad for quick things.

### System Status
Uptime/health monitoring for self-hosted services beyond just Coolify. Ping checks for various domains to see at a glance if everything is up.

### Expense Tracker
Simple monthly spending tracker. Nothing fancy — just categories, amounts, and a monthly total.

## Dashboard Polish

### Greeting with Time-of-Day Context
"Good morning, Sara" with maybe a motivational quote or an "on this day" fact. Small touch that makes the dashboard feel more personal.
